    <br>
    <P> I am a high school student and I’m interested in learning about technology especially coding because it's interesting. 
        Another reason is that it’s beneficial to learn about technology as we are surrounded by technology. 
        Thus, I am currently trying to take more tech classes to learn more about technology. 
        Some of my hobbies are reading, playing video games, listening to music, and etc. 
    </P>
